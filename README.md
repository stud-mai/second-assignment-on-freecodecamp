# second-assignment-on-freecodecamp
This is the second assignment on FreeCodeCamp.com course that is intended to make a personal portfolio webpage. The design was borrowed from the test task for prospective "Advanced Web Development" course students  that is taught by LoftSchool (Saint-Petersburg). The webpage is build bearing in mind four user stories:

1) I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling;\n
2) I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages;
3) I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders);
4) I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.
